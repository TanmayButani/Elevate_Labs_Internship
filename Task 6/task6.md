# Task 6 – Creating and Testing Strong Passwords

## Overview
In this task, I explored what makes a password strong and tested some passwords using free online tools.  
The goal was to see how length, complexity, and randomness affect overall strength.

## What I Did
1. Created four passwords with different complexity levels.
2. Tested each password on [Password Meter](https://passwordmeter.com) to check the score and feedback.
3. Learned about password strength factors and common attack methods.
4. Noted down the best practices for creating secure passwords.

## Passwords I Tested and Their Scores
*(These are just for this exercise — not used anywhere else!)*

1. **Pass123** – Score: **51%** – Short, predictable, and uses a common pattern.  
2. **Mango@2025** – Score: **97%** – Better complexity with symbols and numbers, but still contains a dictionary word.  
3. **Xy!92vLq#18** – Score: **100%** – Strong random mix of characters, numbers, and symbols.  
4. **Sunrise_Over_Mountain$92** – Score: **100%** – Long passphrase with mixed characters, symbols, and numbers; very strong.

## Key Things I Learned
- **Length is crucial** — longer passwords take much more time to crack.
- **Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols** significantly improves security.
- Avoid **predictable patterns** like “123” or “qwerty”.
- **Randomness matters** — the less guessable, the better.
- **Passphrases** are strong if they are unique and long.
- Use a **password manager** to remember complex passwords.
- Always enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for extra protection.

## Common Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack** – tries every possible combination until it succeeds.
- **Dictionary Attack** – tries known words and common phrases.

## Final Note
Before doing this, I thought adding one symbol was enough for security.  
Now I understand it’s about **length + variety + unpredictability**, and pairing it with MFA makes it far more secure.
