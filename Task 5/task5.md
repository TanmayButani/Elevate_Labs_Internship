# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- **Wireshark** (free packet analyzer)

## ðŸ“‹ Steps Followed:
1. Installed Wireshark and started capturing on the active network interface.
2. Generated traffic by browsing websites and performing DNS lookups.
3. Stopped capture after a short duration.
4. Applied protocol filters to capture specific traffic:
   - **HTTP**
   - **DNS**
   - **TCP**
5. Saved the filtered traffic into `.pcapng` files.
6. Took screenshots of filtered traffic.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables:
- **PCAP Files**:
  - `DNS.pcapng`
  - `HTTP.pcapng`
  - `TCP.pcapng`
- **Screenshots**:
  - `DNS_Traffic.png`
  - `HTTP_Traffic.png`
  - `TCP_Traffic.png`

## ðŸ“Š Key Concepts Learned:
- Packet capture and filtering in Wireshark.
- Differences between TCP, HTTP, and DNS traffic.
- How to identify protocols in captured traffic.
- Understanding basic packet structures.
